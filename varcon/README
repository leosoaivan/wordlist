Variant Conversion Info (VARCON)

Revision 4.1

August 10, 2004

Copyright 2000-2004 by Kevin Atkinson (kevina@gnu.org)

This package contains tables to convert between American, British, and
Canadian spellings and vocabulary as well as well as a table listing the 
equivalent forms of other variants.

The latest version can be found at http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/.

<<< NEW TEXT

The varcon.txt file:
  A = American
  B = British "ise" spelling
  Z = British "ize" spelling (OED Spelling)
  C = Canadian

Variants marked
  v = variant (orig. v or V)
  V = seldom used variant (m-w also...)
  - = possible variant (orig. VV)
 
If more than one 'A' (or 'B' ...) on a line than equal variants with
slight preference given the the first one listed.

Sometimes the variant used depends on the meaning, in this case the
same word may be on seperate lines, explaination often given after |.

ends with "| -" means for an obscure meaning of the word

>>> ORIG TEXT

The abbc.tab contains mappings between American, British with "ise"
spelling, British with "ize" spelling (OED Spelling), and Canadian
spellings.  The fields are separated by a tab character and have the
Unix EOL character.  The first four columns are the spellings
respectively.

The last column is used for miscellaneous notes.  With the following
meaning (C-OED = Compact Oxford English Dictionary of Current English)
  A: American words that are also used in British / Canadian spellings
  a: Like A but it not really considered a separate word, rather 
     a variant.  For example "spelled" vs "spelt".
  B: British words that are also used in American / Canadian spellings
  b: Like B but a variant.
  VV: According to C-OED the American spelling is the correct one,
      however, I found some evidence that the British spelling is
      still used.
  V: According to C-OED the American spelling is the preferred form,
      however, the British spelling is also correct
  V?: Same as V, but it seamed inconsistent to me.  Explained below.
  v: According to C-OED the British spelling is the preferred form,
      however the American spelling is also correct.
  !: Explained below.

I am not British, so I don't know the correct Britsh spelling of
words, however a few entries in the C-OED seamed odd to me.  "Color"
is generally spelled "Colour", unless the word is "coloration", as the
C-OED marked "colouration" as a variant.  Thus I marked the entry in
the table with a "V?" instead of a "V?".  "Vapor" is spelled "Vapour"
unless the word is "vaporize".  This seams odd to be, but I could not
find any evidence that "vapourize" or "vapourise" is a legal word,
although I could find some evidence it was used.  Nevertheless since
"vapourize/-ise" doesn't seam to be a valid word, this spelling was
not included.  Effected entries are marked with a "!"

===

The file voc.tab is like abbc.tab except that it converts between
vocabulary instead of spelling.  If more than one word if often uses to
describe the same thing the words are separated with commas.  The last
column contains additional notes on when the word is used.  Unlike
abbc.tab it is generally not suitable for automatic conversion.

The file variant-also.tab contains additional mappings between various
spellings of a word which are not necessarily region dependent.  Only
mappings that are not listed in abbc.tab are included in this mapping.
No attempt is made to distinguish the primary form of a word.  The
file variant-infl.tab is like variant-also.tab except that it is
created automatically from the AGID inflection database.  The file
variant-wroot.tab is like variant-infl.tab except that it also
included the root form of the word.

Both the translation array and variant table includes a lot of strange
affixations of words which I have no intention of removing as some
people might find them useful.

The "make-variant" Perl script will combine abbc.tab, variant-also.tab,
and variant-infl.tab into one huge mapping and will output the result
to "variant.tab".  If the "no-infl" option is given than
variant-infl.tab will not be included.

The "split" script will create 6 words lists from abbc.tab:
american.lst, british.lst, british_z.lst, british_variant.lst,
canadian.lst, and common.lst.  The files american.lst, british.lst,
british_z.lst, canadian.lst contain all the possible words that might
be used by that particular country, except for spelling variants.  The
common.lst file contains words that are included in both the american
and one of the other lists.  The british_variant.lst contains words
which are considered a spelling variant in British English and not
already included in either british.lst or british_z.lst.

The "translate" Perl script will translate a text file from one
spelling to another. Its usage is:

translate <options> [<translation array>] <from> <to>
<options> is any of
  -?,-h,--help this screen
  -m,--mark     mark words where the translation is questionable
  -i,--include  include words where the translation is questionable
<translation array> is the file name of the translation array,
                    defaults to "abbc.tab".
<from> and <to> are one of: american, british, british_z, or canadian.
british-ise and british-ize can also be used.

Text is read in from standard input and is outputted to standard out.
Words are marked with a '?' before and after the questionable word
when the option is enabled.

FIXME: Translate needs to be updated to take variant flags into
account.

If you discover any errors in these mappings, besides the strange
affixations, or have suggestions for additions be sure and let me know
at kevina@gnu.org.

SOURCE:

These mappings were compiled from numerous sources.

The abc.tab was originally created from the American and British word
lists found in the Ispell distribution and the Canadian word list
created by Garst R. Reese <reese@isn.net>:

  What I have discovered is that Canadian is a modification of British.
  Canadians use ize ization, izing izable like Americans, and gram instead
  of gramme. The one exception I found was practise. It does not go to
  practize.  Otherwise they use British spelling. So, what I am currently
  checking books with is a an edited version of British, where I have
  changed all occurrences of ise to ize, isab to izab, isation to ization,
  ising to izing, and gramme to gram except I allow programme, which is
  sometimes proper unless you are talking about a computer program. I did
  bunches of greps to be sure these substitutions would work as expected.

Many other words have been added to abc.tab which were not in the
original Ispell word lists.

Many different web sources were consuled when crating the tables.  They
include:
